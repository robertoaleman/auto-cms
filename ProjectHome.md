**AutoCMS is a smaller CMS,generate a website with minimal requirements to have presence in Internet**

It can present a form in an administration page protected with a password to let the administrator set several options about common site content sections that it supports.

The AutoCMS can generate PHP file with definitions that set configuration options according to the options the user set in the form.

The main application script includes the class and the generated options to determine how to present the site based on the option values.

Currently the AutoCMS can present site pages with automatic headers, footers, a menu bar with links to an about section, news section,Producs and Services, and a contact form.

The page presentation is configurable with CSS styles.

My name is Roberto Aleman, from Venezuela, i am web developer and wrote AutoCMS, since I have seen many managers of webs contents, that they try to please to a major quantity still of users.

Between as many options that it have seen, does not find one that out quickly, valid for the W3C (XHTML and CSS), that could acquire to below cost or free, and finally that was accessible to users that do not know a lot of on Internet or web programming.

My initial idea was to create a CMS in order that the small undertakings or users they work in an autonomous way could have presence on Internet in a quick way and simple.

Something else important has been, create a web that permits make a back of all your content with single unload the FTP way file.
